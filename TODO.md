# TODO

This is un unsorted todo list where I will write every idea I have

## Observation System
* Add more observations, such as movement, pickup etc.
* Make it possible to see observation logs from the game.
* Implement summary function for the log. Use gpt3.5-turbo.

## Word generation
* Probably move from dungeons to open world. See existing implementations.

## Performance
* Handle dead entities more gracefully.

## Bugs
* Observations at the same turn are not always logically ordered. For example, death message may happen before 0 hp message.
