Roguelike with [Generative Agents](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03442.pdf).

Very early stage, work in progress.

## Usage
You will need OpenAI account for it.

Install requirements
```
pip install -r requirements
```

create `.env` file:
```
OPENAI_ORG=<HERE IS YOUR ORG>
OPENAI_SK=<HERE IS YOUR SECRET KEY>
```

Now you can run it with simple `python main.py`.

Be careful because it will make paid requests.
